## Resistance of *Acropora cervicornis* to Disease and Ammonium
![RESISTADA_Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6c706b-d79f-4bbb-a8ae-1db4cbf34ceb)
## Description:

📂 The Data/ directory includes the associated metadata (metadata_RESISTADA.csv), taxonomy (taxonomy_resistada.qza), and ASV (table-BacArc_resistada.qza) tables.
* Taxonomy and ASV files are in a compressed format (qza).

🐍 The Notebook/ directory houses the R code and is provided as Python notebooks, allowing outputs to be viewed alongside the code.

🧾 If notebooks do not render properly on GitHub, you can view them using nbviewer.
